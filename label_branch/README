Run label_trees.m
The file is a GUI. It is meant to draw bounding boxes and the direction vector and radius of the branches. It will also create a text file with the name of the image and the annotations made as content. The annotation is done in the following way.

Each line in the labeled files represents one annotation and have 10 numbers separated by a semi-colon.
[xmin, ymin, width, heigth, x_centre, y_centre, x_end-direction, y_end-direction, x_end-radious, y_end-radious]
xmin, ymin, width, heigth = Bounding box parameters.
x_centre, y_centre = centre of the branch.
x_end-direction, y_end-direction = end point of the direction vector.
x_end-radious, y_end-radious] = end point of the radious vector.

Important commands:
Folder path, Load!, Draw rectangles, Delete points.
Go to their description to know how it works.

HOW IT WORKS:
- Folder path:
	- Insert the path where your folder is located. E.g. /Users/username/Documents/2018/f-rcnn/data/

- Load!:
	- Load all the images in the file.
	- If the folder 'label_files' doesn't exist it will be created to store the labeled files.
	- The Files will be shown in 'Files in folder'.

- Files in folder:
	- Click in one of the files that show in the list will create a text file with the name of the image. Eg. 'Files in folder': img1.jpg -> img1.txt.

- Labels:
	- Shows the annotation made for each image. If it was previously done, it will load them. 

- Draw rectangles:
	- Draw the bounding box, and tree points which represents the centre of the branch, and the end points of the radious and direction vectors.
	- Draw the bounding boxes:
		press, drag and drop.
	- The other 3 points:
		3 clicks and then press enter.

- Delete points:
Select one of the points in the 'labels' list and it will delete the annotation from the list and the annotation text that belongs to the image.
